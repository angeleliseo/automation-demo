# Service Level Objectives

After having a discussing with product (PO) and development (Tech Lead) they mentioned their interest on having the following KPI under the below SLOs:

### Infrastructure Related

| No  | KPI                | SLO    |
| --- | ------------------ | ------ |
| 01  | CPU                | <= 30% |
| 02  | Memory Utilization | <= 70% |


### Application Performance and Load

| No  | KPI                     | SLO        |
| --- | ----------------------- | ---------- |
| 01  | Response Time           | <= 1000 ms |
| 02  | Transactions per Minute | <= 180           |


It is possible new KPIs are added and their corresponding SLO once the team decide which one are key for improving performance in a second stage.
