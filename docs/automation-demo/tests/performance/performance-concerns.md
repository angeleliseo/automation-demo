# Existing Performance Concerns

There was a meeting with the project team, they expressed some issues they have had before on periods of holidays, right before Christmas season they expect an increase of load around **30% more TPS** of business as usual. This has provoked a poor user experience in the past.

Considering the above concern, a stress test scenario will be designed going beyond of expected production load of **3 TPS to 4 TPS**

| No  | Base Load | Projected Peak | Total TPS for Stress Test |
| --- | --------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| 01  | 3 TPS     | +30%           | 4 TPs                     |
