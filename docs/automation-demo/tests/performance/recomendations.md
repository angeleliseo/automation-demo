# Recommendations

- The number of CPUs probably will have to be adjusted to be able to support the load
- Test most likely will require to adjust a bit on load to properly reach the expecte3 TPs 
- it is recommended to include Apache related KPI in next execution iteration to see any unexpected behavior from Apache server side
- It is recommended to restrict the CPU and memory of the container to avoid exhaust the resources of the server and affect any other application hosted in it
- One more iteration of execution post adjustments has to be done
